# 👋 Hi, I'm Abdul Jamal Nasir

**Lead Web Developer | Full-Stack Architect | AI Platform Builder**

I build production-grade web platforms that scale. My work centers on enterprise SaaS systems, multi-tenant architectures, and AI-powered automation platforms — solving complex business problems with clean, maintainable code.

Currently leading development on **Rave 2.0**, a multi-tenant retail & subscription platform, and **AI98**, an AI agent orchestration system with LangGraph workflows and MCP integrations.

## 🧠 What I Build

### Enterprise Platforms
- Multi-tenant SaaS with Laravel Tenancy & service-oriented architecture
- Scalable subscription & pricing engines for retail/e-commerce
- Complex business logic layers with queues, events, and background processing

### Modern Web Applications
- React/TypeScript SPAs with state management and real-time updates
- Admin dashboards with data visualization, drag-and-drop builders, and complex forms
- Component-driven architecture with styled-components and design systems

### AI & Automation Systems
- AI agent orchestration using LangChain and LangGraph
- RAG implementations with vector databases (Pinecone, MongoDB)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations for tool-augmented AI
- WebSocket-based real-time agent communication

## 🧩 Engineering Principles
- Architecture first – Design for scale and maintainability from day one
- Service-oriented – Business logic belongs in services, not controllers or models
- Type safety – Leverage TypeScript and PHP 8+ types to catch errors early
- Pragmatic AI – Use AI where it adds real value, not as a gimmick
- Performance matters – Optimize queries, cache strategically, profile relentlessly
