# 👋 Hi, I’m Abdul Jamal Nasir

**Lead Web Developer | Full-Stack Architect | AI Platform Builder**

I build **production-grade web platforms** designed to scale in real-world environments.  
My work focuses on **enterprise SaaS systems, multi-tenant architectures, and AI-powered automation**, solving complex business problems with clean, maintainable, and predictable code.

I currently lead development on **Rave 2.0**, a multi-tenant retail and subscription platform, and **AI98**, an AI agent orchestration system built on LangGraph workflows and MCP integrations.

## 🧠 What I Build

### Enterprise Platforms
- Multi-tenant SaaS systems using Laravel Tenancy and service-oriented architecture  
- Scalable subscription, pricing, and billing engines for retail and e-commerce  
- Robust business logic layers using queues, events, and background processing  

### Modern Web Applications
- React + TypeScript SPAs with real-time data flows and state management  
- Admin dashboards featuring analytics, drag-and-drop builders, and complex forms  
- Component-driven UI architectures backed by design systems  

### AI & Automation Systems
- AI agent orchestration using LangChain and LangGraph  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases  
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations for tool-augmented AI  
- Real-time agent communication using WebSockets

## 🧩 Engineering Principles
- **Architecture first** — design for scale and longevity  
- **Service-oriented design** — business logic belongs in services  
- **Type safety** — leverage PHP 8+ and TypeScript to fail early  
- **Pragmatic AI** — apply AI only where it delivers real value  
- **Performance matters** — optimize queries, cache deliberately, profile continuously
